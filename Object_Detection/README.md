# Object Detection

This Space provides an interactive demo for detecting objects in images using YOLOv5. Upload any image, and the model will identify and locate objects within it, drawing bounding boxes around detected items and labeling them with their corresponding classes.

## Features
- Supports common image formats (JPG, PNG, etc.)
- Visualizes detection results with bounding boxes
- Displays confidence scores for each detection
- Displays FPS for Video Detection.
